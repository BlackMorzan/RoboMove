# RoboMove


This project was my 1'st year assignment at university PWR. Program visualize objects as well as robots on a plane and allows user to interact with robots using commands (like turn or move forward) in terminal. Robots can detect collisions and leave a trail behind them. 

Main purpose of this project was learning about object oriented programming, implementing someone's code into my own solution, documentation and maintaining code.
